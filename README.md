# Medical Image Series Viewer
This project was built as an initial interview prototype for an Australian AI medical startup [Maxwell Plus](https://maxwellplus.com/) who specialise in Prostate Cancer. I subsequently spent a year at Maxwell leading the development of the patient and diagnostics web applications.

The viewer is utilising core functionality from cornerstone.js and d3.js to show the example medical images.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
